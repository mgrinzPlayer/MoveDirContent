move directory content

Imagine you want to move files and subdirs from **source** directory to the **target** directory. There are
already some files and dirs in the **target** directory which need to be overwritten. Files that are
only present in the target should be left untouched. You want a single command in console. It can be easly achived with shell script under Linux or MacOS. For Windows users...., this project is for you.

This tool should provide that functionality.
